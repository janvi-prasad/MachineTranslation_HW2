# Machine Translation Alignment Tool
# Overview
This tool is designed to perform word alignment for machine translation tasks using IBM Model 2. It translates and aligns words between a source language (e.g., French) and a target language (e.g.,English) based on parallel bilingual corpora.

# Installation
1. Make sure you have python and github on your system


2. Clone the repository to your local machine:  
git clone https://github.com/janvi-prasad/MachineTranslation_HW2.git


3. Navigate to the project directory:  
cd hw2




# Usage
Training and Alignment


1. Train the alignment models using the following command:
Python ibm2.py -n 100000 > alignment.
  This will train IBM Model 2, estimating word alignment probabilities and stores the output in the file alignment.


2. To compute accuracy, run:
Get-Content alignment | python score-alignments 


3. To run the machine translation in one command, you can run: 
python ibm2.py -n 100000 | python score-alignments 

# Models
# Model Type: 


1. IBM Model 1: 
* IBM Model 1, is a simpler model for word alignment. It estimates the conditional probability of a foreign word given an English word. 
* It primarily estimates translation probabilities for each foreign word given an English word. 
* It calculates alignment probabilities based on the Dice coefficient.


* #python3 ibm1.py -n 100000 | python3 score-alignments -> gives an AER value of 0.369




2. IBM Model 2: 
* IBM Model 2, an extension of IBM Model 1. Model 2 incorporates a fertility model, which accounts for the number of words in the target language generated from a source language word. 
* It estimates both word translation probabilities and fertility probabilities. In addition to translation probabilities, Model 2 estimates fertility probabilities, which represent how many times a source word generates target words. 
* Alignment probabilities are calculated using Model 2, which involves both the E-step and M-step to estimate alignment and translation probabilities.


* #python3 ibm2.py -n 100000 | python3 score-alignments -> gives an AER value of 0.339943




# Sample Data
Sample bilingual corpora and pre-trained models are provided for demonstration purposes. You can use these to quickly test the alignment tool. A description of the files are below.


* ‘hansards.e’ is the English side.
* ‘hansards.f’ is the French side.
* ‘hansards.a’ is the alignment of the first 37 sentences. The notation i-j means the word as position i of the French is aligned to the word at position j of the English. Notation i?j means they are probably aligned. Positions are 0-indexed.


# Results
The code results should produce an alignment error rate of 0.339943 (see figure below)
